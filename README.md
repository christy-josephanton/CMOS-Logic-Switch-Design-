# CMOS-Logic-Switch-Design
2 Input XOR Logic gate made using MOSFETS 


The function for the XOR between A and B is:
=A'B+AB'
This is then converted into the negative function, as CMOS logic is inherently inverted:
=((A' B)'(AB')')'
=((A+B')(A'+B))'

((A+B')(A'+B))'

*Note: ' means the varaible is inverted*

The circuit schematic was created using the function above.
